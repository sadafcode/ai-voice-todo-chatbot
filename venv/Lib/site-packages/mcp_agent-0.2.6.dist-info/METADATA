              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## Overview

**`mcp-agent`** is a simple, composable framework to build effective agents using [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

> [!Note]
> mcp-agent's vision is that _MCP is all you need to build agents, and that simple patterns are more robust than complex architectures for shipping high-quality agents_.

`mcp-agent` gives you the following:

1. **Full MCP support**: It _fully_ implements MCP, and handles the pesky business of managing the lifecycle of MCP server connections so you don't have to.
2. **Effective agent patterns**: It implements every pattern described in Anthropic's [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents) in a _composable_ way, allowing you to chain these patterns together.
3. **Durable agents**: It works for simple agents and scales to sophisticated workflows built on [Temporal](https://temporal.io/) so you can pause, resume, and recover without any API changes to your agent.

<u>Altogether, this is the simplest and easiest way to build robust agent applications</u>.

We welcome all kinds of [contributions](/CONTRIBUTING.md), feedback and your help in improving this project.

**Minimal example**

```python
import asyncio

from mcp_agent.app import MCPApp
from mcp_agent.agents.agent import Agent
from mcp_agent.workflows.llm.augmented_llm_openai import OpenAIAugmentedLLM

app = MCPApp(name="hello_world")

async def main():
    async with app.run():
        agent = Agent(
            name="finder",
            instruction="Use filesystem and fetch to answer questions.",
            server_names=["filesystem", "fetch"],
        )
        async with agent:
            llm = await agent.attach_llm(OpenAIAugmentedLLM)
            answer = await llm.generate_str("Summarize README.md in two sentences.")
            print(answer)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

# Add your LLM API key to `mcp_agent.secrets.yaml` or set it in env.

## Get Started

> [!TIP]
> The CLI is available via `uvx mcp-agent`.
> To get up and running,
> scaffold a project with `uvx mcp-agent init` and deploy with `uvx mcp-agent deploy my-agent`.
>
> You can get up and running in 2 minutes by running these commands:
>
> ```bash
> mkdir hello-mcp-agent && cd hello-mcp-agent
> uvx mcp-agent init
> uv init
> uv add "mcp-agent[openai]"
> # Add openai API key to `mcp_agent.secrets.yaml` or set `OPENAI_API_KEY`
> uv run main.py
> ```

### Installation

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage your Python projects (`uv init`).

```bash
uv add "mcp-agent"
```

Alternatively:

```bash
pip install mcp-agent
```

Also add optional packages for LLM providers (e.g. `uv add "mcp-agent[openai, anthropic, google, azure, bedrock]"`).

### Quickstart

> [!TIP]
> The [`examples`](/examples) directory has several example applications to get started with.
> To run an example, clone this repo (or generate one with `uvx mcp-agent init --template basic --dir my-first-agent`)
>
> ```bash
> cd examples/basic/mcp_basic_agent # Or any other example
> # Option A: secrets YAML
> # cp mcp_agent.secrets.yaml.example mcp_agent.secrets.yaml && edit mcp_agent.secrets.yaml
> uv run main.py
> ```

Here is a basic "finder" agent that uses the fetch and filesystem servers to look up a file, read a blog and write a tweet. [Example link](./examples/basic/mcp_basic_agent/):

## Why use `mcp-agent`?

There are too many AI frameworks out there already. But `mcp-agent` is the only one that is purpose-built for a shared protocol - [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).[mcp-agent](https://docs.mcp-agent.com/get-started/welcome) pairs Anthropic’s Building Effective Agents patterns with a batteries-included MCP runtime so you can focus on behaviour, not boilerplate. Teams pick it because it is:

- **Composable** – every pattern ships as a reusable workflow you can mix and match.
- **MCP-native** – any MCP server (filesystem, fetch, Slack, Jira, FastMCP apps) connects without custom adapters.
- **Production ready** – Temporal-backed durability, structured logging, token accounting, and Cloud deploys are first-class.
- **Pythonic** – a handful of decorators and context managers wire everything together.

Docs: [Welcome to mcp-agent](https://docs.mcp-agent.com/get-started/welcome) • [Effective patterns overview](https://docs.mcp-agent.com/mcp-agent-sdk/effective-patterns/overview).

## Core Components

Every project revolves around a single `MCPApp` runtime that loads configuration, registers agents and MCP servers, and exposes tools/workflows. The [Core Components guide](https://docs.mcp-agent.com/mcp-agent-sdk/overview) walks through these building blocks.

### MCPApp

Initialises configuration, logging, tracing, and the execution engine so everything shares one context.

```python
from mcp_agent.app import MCPApp

app = MCPApp(name="finder_app")

async def main():
    async with app.run() as running_app:
        logger = running_app.logger
        logger.info("App ready", data={"servers": list(running_app.context.server_registry.registry)})
```

Docs: [MCPApp](https://docs.mcp-agent.com/mcp-agent-sdk/core-components/mcpapp) • Example: [`examples/basic/mcp_basic_agent`](./examples/basic/mcp_basic_agent/).

### Agents & AgentSpec

Agents couple instructions with the MCP servers (and optional functions) they may call. `AgentSpec` definitions can be loaded from disk and turned into agents or Augmented LLMs with the factory helpers.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from mcp_agent.agents.agent import Agent
from mcp_agent.workflows.factory import load_agent_specs_from_file

agent = Agent(
    name="researcher",
    instruction="Research topics using web and filesystem access",
    server_names=["fetch", "filesystem"],
)

async with agent:
    tools = await agent.list_tools()

async with app.run() as running_app:
    specs = load_agent_specs_from_file(
        str(Path("examples/basic/agent_factory/agents.yaml")),
        context=running_app.context,
    )
```

Docs: [Agents](https://docs.mcp-agent.com/mcp-agent-sdk/core-components/agents) • [Agent factory helpers](https://docs.mcp-agent.com/mcp-agent-sdk/core-components/agents#agentspec-and-factory-helpers) • Examples: [`examples/basic/agent_factory`](./examples/basic/agent_factory/).

### Augmented LLM

Augmented LLMs wrap provider SDKs with the agent’s tools, memory, and structured output helpers. Attach one to an agent to unlock `generate`, `generate_str`, and `generate_structured`.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from mcp_agent.workflows.llm.augmented_llm import RequestParams
from mcp_agent.workflows.llm.augmented_llm_openai import OpenAIAugmentedLLM

class Summary(BaseModel):
    title: str
    verdict: str

async with agent:
    llm = await agent.attach_llm(OpenAIAugmentedLLM)
    report = await llm.generate_str(
        message="Draft a 3-sentence release note from CHANGELOG.md",
        request_params=RequestParams(maxTokens=400, temperature=0.2),
    )
    structured = await llm.generate_structured(
        message="Return a JSON object with `title` and `verdict` summarising the README.",
        response_model=Summary,
    )
```

Docs: [Augmented LLMs](https://docs.mcp-agent.com/mcp-agent-sdk/core-components/augmented-llm) • Examples: [`examples/basic/mcp_basic_agent`](./examples/basic/mcp_basic_agent/) and the workflow projects listed in [gallery.md](gallery.md#workflow-patterns).

### Workflows & decorators

`MCPApp` decorators convert coroutines into durable workflows and tools. The same annotations work for both `asyncio` and Temporal execution.

```python
from datetime import timedelta
from mcp_agent.executor.workflow import Workflow, WorkflowResult

@app.workflow
class PublishArticle(Workflow[WorkflowResult[str]]):
    @app.workflow_task(schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5))
    async def draft(self, topic: str) -> str:
        return f"- intro to {topic}\n- highlights\n- next steps"

    @app.workflow_run
    async def run(self, topic: str) -> WorkflowResult[str]:
        outline = await self.draft(topic)
        return WorkflowResult(value=outline)
```

Docs: [Decorator reference](https://docs.mcp-agent.com/reference/decorators) • Examples: [`examples/workflows`](./examples/workflows/).

### Configuration & secrets

Settings load from `mcp_agent.config.yaml`, `mcp_agent.secrets.yaml`, environment variables, and optional preload strings. Keep secrets out of source control.

```yaml
# mcp_agent.config.yaml
execution_engine: asyncio
mcp:
  servers:
    fetch:
      command: "uvx"
      args: ["mcp-server-fetch"]
    filesystem:
      command: "npx"
      args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"]
openai:
  default_model: gpt-4o-mini

# mcp_agent.secrets.yaml (gitignored)
openai:
  api_key: "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
```

Docs: [Configuration reference](https://docs.mcp-agent.com/reference/configuration) • [Specify secrets](https://docs.mcp-agent.com/mcp-agent-sdk/core-components/specify-secrets).

### MCP integration

Connect to existing MCP servers programmatically or aggregate several into one façade.

```python
from mcp_agent.mcp.gen_client import gen_client

async with app.run():
    async with gen_client("filesystem", app.server_registry, context=app.context) as client:
        resources = await client.list_resources()
        app.logger.info("Filesystem resources", data={"uris": [r.uri for r in resources.resources]})
```

Docs: [MCP integration overview](https://docs.mcp-agent.com/mcp/overview) • Examples: [`examples/mcp`](./examples/mcp/).

## Workflow patterns

Key agent patterns are implemented as an `AugmentedLLM`. Use factory helpers to wire them up or inspect the runnable projects listed in [gallery.md](gallery.md#workflow-patterns).

| Pattern               | Helper                                                                          | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Docs                                                                                                   |

## Durable execution

Switch `execution_engine` to `temporal` for pause/resume, retries, human input, and durable history—without changing workflow code. Run a worker alongside your app to host activities.

```python
from mcp_agent.executor.temporal import create_temporal_worker_for_app

async with create_temporal_worker_for_app(app) as worker:
    await worker.run()
```

Docs: [Durable agents](https://docs.mcp-agent.com/mcp-agent-sdk/advanced/durable-agents) • [Temporal backend](https://docs.mcp-agent.com/advanced/temporal) • Examples: [`examples/temporal`](./examples/temporal/).

## Agent servers

Expose an `MCPApp` as a standard MCP server so Claude Desktop, Cursor, or custom clients can call your tools and workflows.

```python
from mcp_agent.server import create_mcp_server_for_app

@app.tool
def grade_story(story: str) -> str:
    return "Report..."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    server = create_mcp_server_for_app(app)

## CLI reference

`uvx mcp-agent` scaffolds projects, manages secrets, inspects workflows, and deploys to Cloud.

```bash
uvx mcp-agent init --template basic             # Scaffold a new project
uvx mcp-agent deploy my-agent                   # Deploy to mcp-agent Cloud
```

## Authentication

Load API keys from secrets files or use the built-in OAuth client to fetch and persist tokens for MCP servers.

```yaml
# mcp_agent.config.yaml excerpt
oauth:
  providers:
    github:
      client_id: "${GITHUB_CLIENT_ID}"
      client_secret: "${GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET}"
      scopes: ["repo", "user"]
```

## Advanced

### Observability & controls

Enable structured logging and OpenTelemetry via configuration, and track token usage programmatically.

```yaml
# mcp_agent.config.yaml
logger:
  transports: [console]
  level: info
otel:
  enabled: true
  exporters:
    - console
```

`TokenCounter` tracks token usage for agents, workflows, and LLM nodes. Attach watchers to stream updates or trigger alerts.

```python
# Inside `async with app.run() as running_app:`
# token_counter lives on the running app context when tracing is enabled.
token_counter = running_app.context.token_counter

class TokenMonitor:
    async def on_token_update(self, node, usage):
        print(f"[{node.name}] total={usage.total_tokens}")

monitor = TokenMonitor()
watch_id = await token_counter.watch(
    callback=monitor.on_token_update,
    node_type="llm",
    threshold=1_000,
    include_subtree=True,
)

await token_counter.unwatch(watch_id)
```

Docs: [Observability](https://docs.mcp-agent.com/mcp-agent-sdk/advanced/observability) • Examples: [`examples/tracing`](./examples/tracing/).

### Composing workflows

Mix and match AgentSpecs to build higher-level workflows using the factory helpers—routers, parallel pipelines, orchestrators, and more.

```python
from mcp_agent.workflows.factory import create_router_llm

# specs are loaded via load_agent_specs_from_file as shown above.
async with app.run() as running_app:
    router = await create_router_llm(
        agents=specs,
        provider="openai",
        context=running_app.context,
    )
```

Docs: [Workflow composition](https://docs.mcp-agent.com/mcp-agent-sdk/advanced/composition) • Examples: [`examples/basic/agent_factory`](./examples/basic/agent_factory/).

### Signals & human input

Pause workflows for approvals or extra data. Temporal stores state durably until an operator resumes the run.

```python
from mcp_agent.human_input.types import HumanInputRequest

response = await self.context.request_human_input(
    HumanInputRequest(
        prompt="Approve the draft?",
        required=True,
        metadata={"workflow_id": self.context.workflow_id},
    )
)
```

Resume with `mcp-agent cloud workflows resume … --payload '{"content": "approve"}'`. Docs: [Deploy agents – human input](https://docs.mcp-agent.com/cloud/use-cases/deploy-agents#human-in-the-loop-patterns) • Examples: [`examples/human_input/temporal`](./examples/human_input/temporal/).

### App configuration

Build `Settings` objects programmatically when you need dynamic config (tests, multi-tenant hosts) instead of YAML files.

```python
from mcp_agent.config import Settings, MCPSettings, MCPServerSettings

settings = Settings(
    execution_engine="asyncio",
    mcp=MCPSettings(
        servers={
            "fetch": MCPServerSettings(command="uvx", args=["mcp-server-fetch"]),
        }
    ),
)
app = MCPApp(name="configured_app", settings=settings)
```

Docs: [Configuring your application](https://docs.mcp-agent.com/mcp-agent-sdk/core-components/configuring-your-application).

### Icons

Add icons to agents and tools so MCP clients that support imagery (Claude Desktop, Cursor) render richer UIs.

```python
from base64 import standard_b64encode
from pathlib import Path
from mcp_agent.icons import Icon

icon_data = standard_b64encode(Path("my-icon.png").read_bytes()).decode()
icon = Icon(src=f"data:image/png;base64,{icon_data}", mimeType="image/png", sizes=["64x64"])

app = MCPApp(name="my_app_with_icon", icons=[icon])

@app.tool(icons=[icon])
async def my_tool() -> str:
    return "Hello with style"
```

Docs: [`MCPApp` icons](https://docs.mcp-agent.com/mcp-agent-sdk/core-components/mcpapp#icons) • Examples: [`examples/mcp_agent_server/asyncio`](./examples/mcp_agent_server/asyncio/).

### MCP server management

Use `MCPAggregator` or `gen_client` to manage MCP server connections and expose combined tool sets.

```python
from mcp_agent.mcp.mcp_aggregator import MCPAggregator

async with MCPAggregator.create(server_names=["fetch", "filesystem"]) as aggregator:
    tools = await aggregator.list_tools()
```

## Cloud deployment

Deploy to mcp-agent Cloud for managed Temporal execution, secrets, and HTTPS MCP endpoints.

```bash
uvx mcp-agent login
uvx mcp-agent deploy my-agent
uvx mcp-agent cloud apps list
```

## FAQs

### What are the core benefits of using mcp-agent?

mcp-agent provides a streamlined approach to building AI agents using capabilities exposed by **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) servers.

MCP is quite low-level, and this framework handles the mechanics of connecting to servers, working with LLMs, handling external signals (like human input) and supporting persistent state via durable execution. That lets you, the developer, focus on the core business logic of your AI application.

Core benefits:

- 🤝 **Interoperability**: ensures that any tool exposed by any number of MCP servers can seamlessly plug in to your agents.
- ⛓️ **Composability & Customizability**: Implements well-defined workflows, but in a composable way that enables compound workflows, and allows full customization across model provider, logging, orchestrator, etc.
- 💻 **Programmatic control flow**: Keeps things simple as developers just write code instead of thinking in graphs, nodes and edges. For branching logic, you write `if` statements. For cycles, use `while` loops.
- 🖐️ **Human Input & Signals**: Supports pausing workflows for external signals, such as human input, which are exposed as tool calls an Agent can make.

### Do you need an MCP client to use mcp-agent?

No, you can use mcp-agent anywhere, since it handles MCPClient creation for you. This allows you to leverage MCP servers outside of MCP hosts like Claude Desktop.

Here's all the ways you can set up your mcp-agent application:

#### MCP-Agent Server

You can expose mcp-agent applications as MCP servers themselves (see [example](./examples/mcp_agent_server)), allowing MCP clients to interface with sophisticated AI workflows using the standard tools API of MCP servers. This is effectively a server-of-servers.

#### MCP Client or Host

You can embed mcp-agent in an MCP client directly to manage the orchestration across multiple MCP servers.

#### Standalone

You can use mcp-agent applications in a standalone fashion (i.e. they aren't part of an MCP client). The [`examples`](/examples/) are all standalone applications.

### How do I deploy to Cloud?

Run `uvx mcp-agent deploy <app-name>` after logging in with `uvx mcp-agent login`. The CLI packages your project, provisions secrets, and exposes an MCP endpoint backed by a durable Temporal runtime. See the [Cloud quickstart](https://docs.mcp-agent.com/get-started/
cloud) for step-by-step screenshots and CLI output.

### Where is the API reference?

Every class, decorator, and CLI command is documented on [docs.mcp-agent.com](https://docs.mcp-agent.com). The [API reference](https://docs.mcp-agent.com/reference) and the [`llms-full.txt`](https://docs.mcp-agent.com/llms-full.txt) are designed so LLMs (or you) can ingest the whole surface area easily.

### Tell me a fun fact

I debated naming this project _silsila_ (سلسلہ), which means chain of events in Urdu. mcp-agent is more matter-of-fact, but there's still an easter egg in the project paying homage to silsila.
